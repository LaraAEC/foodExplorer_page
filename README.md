- Rendering images of dishes along with all their details such as price, description, and ingredients
- Responsive application, following the "mobile-first" design approach
- Includes animations, screen transitions, loaders, and stylized alerts
- Data in JSON format
- Clear routes
- Authentication and authorization through forms
- Support for HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
- Suporte Ã s requisiÃ§Ãµes HTTP: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH e DELETE

# Funcionalidades
Considering the two personas that can log in, here are the following considerations.
### Administrator's Responsibilities:
- Create, view, edit, and delete dishes from the menu of the administered restaurant

- Track all orders placed by customers on the Orders page and assign a status to each order until its delivery, keeping the user informed about the order's progress

- Search for dishes by title or ingredient
### User's Responsibilities:

- View dishes listed in the Menu, click on a chosen dish, and navigate to the Details screen with its complete description

- Add items to the cart by clicking the "Add" button. The quantity is controlled by the "-" and "+" buttons.

- Clicking the "My Order" button redirects the user to a screen where they can view their order, the total sum, and payment methods

- Remove a dish from the cart, and the total order value should automatically update

- Mark a dish as a favorite, simply click on the heart icon that appears next to each one, as well as remove it from favorites in the same manner.

- Make payments via Pix or card (simulation)

- Track their order and view its status at any moment

- Search for dishes by title or ingredient

# Usage Guidelines
- To install the project dependencies and initiate its functionality, execute the command npm i or yarn i in the terminal. It's important to run this command to ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed correctly.

- It's necessary to register and then proceed with the login. Only registered users can view the Menu and place orders.

- The routes for the administrator differ from those presented to the user, as the authorizations for Menu usage vary. Refer to "Features" section.

- The administrator and the user are identified through the isAdmin logic developed in the backend to be consumed. This logic returns a boolean value; if it's "1," it indicates an administrator, and if it's "0," it signifies a user. This value should already be configured directly in the database, with "1" indicating an administrator role.
